**GitHub Project Description:**

📊 **Supervised Learning for Student Percentage Prediction**

This project utilizes logistic regression in a supervised learning setting to predict students' percentages based on relevant features. By employing machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a robust and accurate model for educational performance forecasting.

🚀 **Key Features:**
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Implemented a logistic regression algorithm to model the relationship between input features and student performance.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to ensure the model's effectiveness.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilized appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
- **Scalability:** Designed the solution to scale with larger datasets, allowing for broader applications and improved predictive accuracy.

🛠️ **Technology Stack:**
- **Python:** Leveraged the power of Python for data manipulation, preprocessing, and implementing the logistic regression model using popular libraries like NumPy and pandas.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Incorporated Scikit-Learn for efficient machine learning tools, model training, and evaluation.
- **GitHub Actions:** Implemented CI/CD workflows using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

📈 **Usage:**
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

🤝 **Contributions:**
Contributions are welcome! Whether it's optimizing the model, improving data preprocessing techniques, or enhancing documentation, we encourage collaboration to make this project even better.
